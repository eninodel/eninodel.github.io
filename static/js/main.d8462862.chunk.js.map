My name is Edwin and I am a student at the University of Washington studying Computer Science with a focus on software engineering. I am committed to utilizing my skills to further the mission of a company by setting and accomplishing clear, specific goals. In my free time I enjoy working on personal coding projects and spending time outside in the beautiful PNW.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        My coding journey has not been a straight path. Originally, I was a pre-dental student heavily studying biology and chemistry. I had never written a line of code before 2020. My life was changed during March of 2020 as COVID-19 caused my school education to be taken online. During this time, I decided to learn how to code out of curiosity as I saw Codecademy offering students 90 days of their premium subscription for free. I seized the opportunity and started to learn Python.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Codecademy was great at first. I learned the basics of syntax and was spoon fed introductory concepts like control flow and basic data structures. However, there came a point in which I was tired of learning and itching to create. I decided I wanted to make a script that tracked the price of a product on Amazon each day and sent me a notification when the product was at a discount. I quickly realized that there were many things I did not know about programming in creating this project. I spent many days researching and teaching myself concepts such as browser automation, error handling, and REST APIâ€™s. Once completing the project, I realized that I could do much more than a simple price tracker.</p>\r\n        <p>Since then, I have done various projects and have had many experiences involving software. With each of these experiences, I have continued to learn more each time.</p>\r\n        <p class=\"bottom-paragraph\">Overall, I love to solve problems. Code is simply a tool to solve problems in a technology focused world. The problems it can solve are fascinating and endless and I want to take part in the process.</p>\r\n        <hr />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n","function ProfessorRanker() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h2>Professor Ranker - A Better Rate My Professor</h2>\r\n      <p class=\"bottom-paragraph\">\r\n        As a college student, I have to register for classes every quarter. Like\r\n        most students, I try and register for the best professors I find on Rate\r\n        My Professor.com. However, I find that some professors do not have many\r\n        reviews and sometimes I find the reviews confusing and inconsistent.\r\n        Additionally, it is very time consuming to look up each professor by\r\n        hand. So, I decided to automate the process and use the{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/assessment/course-evaluations/cec/\">\r\n          UW Course Evaluation Catalog\r\n        </a>{\" \"}\r\n        to my advantage. The UW Course Evaluation Catalog (UWCEC) is essentially\r\n        an official internal Rate My Professor made by UW. In my opinion, it has\r\n        better and more accurate evaluations of professors. By leveraging the\r\n        UWCEC and Python, I was able to write a script that quickly finds the\r\n        best professor for any class at UW. By writing this script, I not only\r\n        saved myself time, but I also learned valuable webcrawling skills.

I quickly discovered that keeping track of my workouts and progress was difficult. I tried out a few workout apps but every app I tried was either cumbersome to use or ineffective. Being a student with plenty of time, I created an app which allows me to keep track of my workouts with all the features I want. My app allows users to quickly log and keep track of their workouts while still being simple to use. One of the features I made sure to implement was the ability to add a link demonstrating each workout. This feature has saved me a lot of time since I will often forget how to do specific workouts.

I grew up playing multiple instruments such as piano and alto sax. I listen to a lot of music as well. However, I have always felt that the current music platforms, while great for listening to music, are not so great for sharing good music with others. So, I created JamShare, a website that allows users to share music recommendations to others. It allows users to post, like, and comment  on other people's music recommendations. Additionally, it is integrated with Spotify so users can easily save any songs they like directly into their Spotify accounts. This project was my first full stack application.
