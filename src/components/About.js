          Hello! My name is Edwin and I am a student at the University of
          Washington intending to study computer engineering / science with a
          focus on software. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal coding
          projects and exploring the outdoors in the pacific northwest. My
          coding journey has not been a straight path. Originally, I was a
          pre-health student heavily studying biology and chemistry. I had never
          written a line of code before last year. My life was changed in March
          of 2020 as COVID-19 caused my school education to be taken online.
          During this time, I decided to learn how to code out of curiosity as I
          saw Codecademy offering students 90 days of their premium subscription
          for free. I seized the opportunity and started to learn Python.
          Codecademy was great at first. I learned the basics of syntax and was
          spoon fed introductory concepts like control flow and basic data
          structures. However, there came a point in which I was tired of
          learning and itching to create. I jumped into the deep end and decided
          I wanted to make a script that tracked the price of a product on
          Amazon each day and sent me a notification when the product was at a
          discount. I quickly realized that there were many things I did not
          know about programming in creating this project and spent many days
          researching and teaching myself browser automation, error handling,
          and REST APIâ€™s. Once completing the project, I realized that I could
          do much more than a simple price tracker. Since then, I have done
          various projects and have continued to learn more each time. My main
          goal right now is to combine the power of computing with biological
          sciences. To accomplish this goal, I have I been helping with front
          end development in a project called{" "}
          <a href="https://deeptracer.uw.edu/home">DeepTracer</a>. DeepTracer is
          a research project led by Dr. Dong Si at UW Bothell that uses machine
          learning to predict the atomic structures of proteins based on 3D
          images. I enjoy working on this project because I can use code to
          apply my past knowledge of biology and chemistry. I hope to be able to
          move to working on the backend of the project in the future. Overall,
          I love to solve problems. Code is simply a tool to solve problems in a
          technology focused world. The problems it can solve are fascinating
          and endless and I want to take part in the process.
