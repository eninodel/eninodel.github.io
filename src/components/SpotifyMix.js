      <h2>Spotify Mix - A Feature I Wish Spotify Had</h2>
      <p class="bottom-paragraph">
        I listen to music a lot and my primary source is Spotify. Spotify is
        great because I can listen to virtually anything I want on demand
        without pesky ads. As robust as Spotify may be, I found myself wanting
        something more. I have multiple different playlists for different moods
        but I was getting bored of them. I wanted to discover more music but I
        found Spotify's explore pages boring so I decided to create my own way
        of discovering new music. Using Spotify's API, I wrote a script which
        takes any playlist of mine and replaces each song with a different
        random song by the same artist. This creates a new playlist which allows
        me to easily discover songs by the same artists I already enjoy. This
        method has lead to me discovering much more music that I like compared
        to Spotify's explore pages. By completing this project, I increased my
        knowledge of API's and best practices when using them. Click{" "}
