My name is Edwin and I am a student at the University of\r\n          Washington studying computer science with a focus on software. In my\r\n          free time, I enjoy working on personal coding projects and exploring\r\n          the outdoors in the PNW. My coding journey has not been a straight\r\n          path. Originally, I was a pre-health student heavily studying biology\r\n          and chemistry. I had never written a line of code before last year. My\r\n          life was changed in March of 2020 as COVID-19 caused my school\r\n          education to be taken online. During this time, I decided to learn how\r\n          to code out of curiosity as I saw Codecademy offering students 90 days\r\n          of their premium subscription for free. I seized the opportunity and\r\n          started to learn Python. Codecademy was great at first. I learned the\r\n          basics of syntax and was spoon fed introductory concepts like control\r\n          flow and basic data structures. However, there came a point in which I\r\n          was tired of learning and itching to create. I jumped into the deep\r\n          end and decided I wanted to make a script that tracked the price of a\r\n          product on Amazon each day and sent me a notification when the product\r\n          was at a discount. I quickly realized that there were many things I\r\n          did not know about programming in creating this project and spent many\r\n          days researching and teaching myself browser automation, error\r\n          handling, and REST APIâ€™s. Once completing the project, I realized that\r\n          I could do much more than a simple price tracker. Since then, I have\r\n          done various projects and have continued to learn more each time.\r\n          Recently, I have I helped with frontend development in a project\r\n          called <a href=\"https://deeptracer.uw.edu/home\">DeepTracer</a>.\r\n          DeepTracer is a research project led by Dr. Dong Si at UW Bothell that\r\n          uses machine learning to predict the atomic structures of proteins\r\n          based on 3D images. I enjoy working on this project because I can use\r\n          code to apply my past knowledge of biology and chemistry. Overall, I\r\n          love to solve problems. Code is simply a tool to solve problems in a\r\n          technology focused world. The problems it can solve are fascinating\r\n          and endless and I want to take part in the process.\r\n        </p>{\" \"}\r\n        <hr />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n","function ProfessorRanker() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h2>Professor Ranker - A Better Rate My Professor</h2>\r\n      <p class=\"bottom-paragraph\">\r\n        As a college student, I have to register for classes every quarter. Like\r\n        most students, I try and register for the best professors I find on Rate\r\n        My Professor.com. However, I find that some professors do not have many\r\n        reviews and sometimes I find the reviews confusing and inconsistent.\r\n        Additionally, it is very time consuming to look up each professor by\r\n        hand. So, I decided to automate the process and use the{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/assessment/course-evaluations/cec/\">\r\n          UW Course Evaluation Catalog\r\n        </a>{\" \"}\r\n        to my advantage. The UW Course Evaluation Catalog (UWCEC) is essentially\r\n        an official internal Rate My Professor made by UW. In my opinion, it has\r\n        better and more accurate evaluations of professors. By leveraging the\r\n        UWCEC and Python, I was able to write a script that quickly finds the\r\n        best professor for any class at UW. By writing this script, I not only\r\n        saved myself time, but I also learned valuable webcrawling skills.

Spotify especially has me locked in\r\n        with its endless supply of music recommendations. While I liked\r\n        Spotify's curated playlists, I wished there was an easy way to checkout\r\n        song recommendations from my friends. Starting with this idea, I made\r\n        Jam Share, a full stack application which allows users to share and post\r\n        about their song recommendations! I took inspiration from Instagram\r\n        where users can post, comment, and like other posts. In the process of\r\n        working on this project, I increased my knowledge of full stack\r\n        development and how an application goes from idea to reality.

Spotify is\r\n        great because I can listen to virtually anything I want on demand\r\n        without pesky ads. As robust as Spotify may be, I found myself wanting\r\n        something more. I have multiple different playlists for different moods\r\n        but I was getting bored of them. I wanted to discover more music but I\r\n        found Spotify's explore pages boring so I decided to create my own way\r\n        of discovering new music. Using Spotify's API, I wrote a script which\r\n        takes any playlist of mine and replaces each song with a different\r\n        random song by the same artist. This creates a new playlist which allows\r\n        me to easily discover songs by the same artists I already enjoy. This\r\n        method has lead to me discovering much more music that I like compared\r\n        to Spotify's explore pages. By completing this project, I increased my\r\n        knowledge of API's and best practices when using them.
